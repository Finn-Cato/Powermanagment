Power Guard monitors your household power consumption in real-time using a HAN electricity meter and automatically controls devices when you approach your grid limit. It prevents costly peak penalties and tripped breakers by intelligently managing EV chargers, thermostats and other appliances.

When power consumption gets too high, Power Guard steps in — reducing charger current, lowering thermostat temperatures or turning off devices in your chosen priority order. Once consumption drops to a safe level, everything is automatically restored. Set it up once and let it protect your home around the clock.
